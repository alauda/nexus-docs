Due to restrictive limitations in Nexus 3.81 Community Edition, **this version has been discontinued**. Once usage reaches the quota limits (100,000 total components and 200,000 requests per day), the instance will cease to function properly.

**If you have already upgraded to version 3.81, please follow the [Rollback to Nexus 3.76](../howto/04_rollback_to_3.76.mdx) guide to downgrade.**
